Hello,
This is my first game project on python
I watched the playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_ on YouTube and
understand the basics of pyGame and how to construct a game engine for 2D turn based table game.
Then I manipulated this project and made a simple checkers version of this engine.
